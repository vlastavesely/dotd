.SH NAME
.B dotd
- a helper for management of flat configuration files


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dotd
.RI [ OPTION "]...


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dotd
is a simple administrative utility for dynamic generation of flat configuration
files from a
.I *.d
directory.

Ideally, every configuration would implement inclusion of
configuration overrides that could be shipped using the package manager or
manipulated from shell scripts. But since this is not always the case, it is
sometimes needed to simulate the same behaviour in another way. This program
does the task: it moves the original configuration file into a
.I *.d
directory, alongside other fragment files, and then rewrites the original file
by the contents of all fragment files concatenated together.

The program does
.I not
watch the fragment files for changes so it has to be instructed manually to
regenerate the configuration.
