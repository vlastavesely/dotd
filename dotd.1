.SH NAME
.B dotd
- a helper for management of flat configuration files


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dotd
.RI [ OPTION "]... [" FILE "]"


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dotd
is a simple administrative utility for dynamic generation of flat configuration
files from a
.I *.d
directory.

Ideally, every configuration would implement inclusion of configuration
overrides that could be shipped using a package manager or manipulated from
shell scripts. But since this is not always the case, it is sometimes needed
to simulate the same behaviour in another way. This program does the task:
it moves the original configuration file into a
.I *.d
directory, alongside other fragment files, and then rewrites the original file
by the contents of all fragment files concatenated together.

The program does
.I not
watch the fragment files for changes so it has to be instructed manually to
regenerate the configuration.

.SH EXAMPLE
Let us say that you want to manage the entries in
.IR /etc/hosts .
In such a case, you need to instruct
.B dotd
to manage the file and then you can add your own configuration fragments:

    dotd -t /etc/hosts || dotd -i /etc/hosts
    echo "1.1.1.1  hostname" >/etc/hosts.d/20-hostname
    dotd -u /etc/hosts

At this point, the file contains the original directives as well as the new one.
