Management of Flat Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This project originated from the need to easily and reliably add entries into
the ‘/etc/hosts’ file from shell scripts.

The principle behind the program is simple: the program copies the original
file into a ‘*.d’ directory where you can put your own additional configuration
files. When the files are ready, you can run ‘dotd -u FILE’ command which will
simply concatenate all the files and overwrite the original file.

There are some similar projects on the Internet that aim to solve the very
same problem but the aim of this program is to be as simple as possible, without
any cool features like watching for changes, etc. Honouring the UNIX principles,
this program attempts to solve the problem as simply and as reliably as
possible.


Example
-------
If you want, for example, to add some entries into ‘/etc/hosts’, you need to
instruct ‘dotd’ to manage the file and then you can to update the file:

  # dotd -t /etc/hosts || dotd -i /etc/hosts
  # echo "1.1.1.1  hostname" >/etc/hosts.d/20-hostname
  # dotd -u /etc/hosts
